## Challenge! 
Start with your Airbnb homework. 

Requirements:
Write an external javascript file and load it into your airbnb mockup page. Using jQuery accomplish the following:
 1. Clicking on any city image logs the click to the console
 2. Clicking on one of the images links you to the Airbnb homepage. 
 3. This image that links to the real airbnb site changes each time the page load. Sometimes it's the first image, sometimes it's the 3rd, etc.
 4. Before the image takes you to the airbnb homepage, display an alert to the user that tells the user: "You found the right city!"
**Bonus**
 - This looks ahead to javascript events:
 1. When you mouseover an image of a city, display another image of the same city. When you mouseout of the city, the image returns to the original image.
